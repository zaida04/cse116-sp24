This repository is an archive of the material I've created for the Spring 2024 semester of CSE116.

I held a bi-weekly review for students who felt they were falling behind. The code for those reviews is under the reviews/ directory.

I also covered some lectures. The material I made for those lectures is under the lectures/ directory.

And finally, I held a workshop for grad students to give a crash course about Java. That is located under the workshop/ directory.
